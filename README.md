Create a new project - FamilyTree. It will have a Person class. This class will have fields such as:
Name
Age
Mom (Person class type)
Dad (Person class type)
Siblings: (Person class array type)

Number of known relatives (should be calculated automatically, not just written down by number!)
The project must have a getMe () function:
Person, which will return an object of class Person filled with your data.
